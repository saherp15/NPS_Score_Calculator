# NPS_Score_Calculator

*This code is used to calculate the Net Promoter Score (NPS) using the responses from a survey.<br>
The code reads in a text file named survey.txt using the numpy library and calculates the NPS using the following formula:<br>


NPS = % Promoters - % Detractors<br>
The code then prints the NPS score rounded to the nearest integer.<br>

## Usage
To use this code, you will need to have a text file named survey.txt containing the survey responses in integer format. The responses should range from 1 to 10.<br>
Once you have the survey.txt file, you can run the code in any Python environment. The code was originally run in Google Colab, but it should work in any Python environment with the necessary libraries installed.<br>

##Dependencies<br>
This code requires the following libraries:<br>
* numpy
